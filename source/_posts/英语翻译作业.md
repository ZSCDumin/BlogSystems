1. 德.汤说过，一切进步，一切发展均来自挑战及由此引起的反应。没有挑战就没有反应，没有发展，没有自由。所以，我们首先应该在我们孩子的能力允许的范围内为他们开设最严格最富有挑战性的课程。
2. 我们可以向我们的孩子提供第二个机会是允许他们有失败的权力。德.纽伊写道：“不仅是一种特权，也是一种考验。”如果没有人可以失败，那它算什么考验，算什么自由呢？美国可以向所有在高中读者完四年课程而不管其是否取得任何明显收获的学生发放毕业文凭的日子已经一去不复返了。我们现在生活在一个外变得很狭隘的世界里，我们必须同对现实保持警觉，有所认识；而现实主义要求树立一个要么成功要么失败的标准。这些话听起来很刺耳，但都是残酷的事实。如果我们剥夺了孩子的失败权力，实际上我们就剥夺了他们如实地认识世界的机会。

9. I didn't even speak to him; much less discuss the reconstruction of your school with him.
